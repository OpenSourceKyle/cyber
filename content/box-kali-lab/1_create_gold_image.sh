# This script automates the creation of the 'gold_image' snapshot.
# It provisions, halts, and then snapshots the VM.

# USAGE:
#   ./1_create_gold_image.sh        (Runs in interactive mode, will ask for confirmation)
#   ./1_create_gold_image.sh -f     (Runs in non-interactive mode, overwrites without asking)
#   ./1_create_gold_image.sh --force (Same as -f)
